#### Plot Review

Overall, I think this is a very clear plot that is well designed and answering an interesting question. Good work!

##### Clarity

The plot is easy to read and the chosen features are unambiguous. One thing that might have made it more clear is to have the colors in the legend and the colors on the plot match--it looks like maybe it layered the colors blue and pink to make purple? I also wasn't sure what the dots on the top of the bars represented.

##### Aesthetic

I think the stacked bar chart is a very clear and straightforward choice to communicate this kind of data and make it easy for the reader to quickly see the patterns in usage across the days of the week. Other than the quick color fix, I think the aesthetic of this chart is very good. It is also color compliant.

##### Honesty

This chart does an honest job of representing the relationship between ridership and the day of the week, as well as the relationship between short trips and long trips.
