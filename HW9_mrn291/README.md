# Homework Assignment 9 for PUI2018 Evening Session

#### Assignment 1
For this assignment, we were asked to review two plots made by our classmates.  I reviewed [this plot](https://github.com/tisola/PUI2018_ti582/blob/master/HW8_ti582/README.md) and [this plot](https://github.com/louisalulu/PUI2018_ml4922/blob/master/HW8_ml4922/README.md).  Reviews are available [here](https://github.com/tharma3/PUI2018_mrn291/blob/master/HW9_mrn291/ti582_plotReview_mrn291.md) and [here](https://github.com/tharma3/PUI2018_mrn291/blob/master/HW9_mrn291/ml4922_plotReview_mrn291.md) respectively, and have also been submitted to my classmates via pull request.

#### Assignment 2
For this assignment, we were asked to do some confusing things that I am not sure I totally understood, but I took a crack.

For this assignment, I discussed the initial line function defined in the skeleton notebook with Christine Biddlecombe and Katie Voorhees.  Otherwise I completed the assignment independently.

#### Assignment 3
For this assignment, we were asked to gather data about firearms and related statistics, as well as total population and GDP data by country from various sources.  We made some exploratory plots and then fitted a line to the relationship between the number of mass shootings per person as a function of average total of all civilian firearms per person.

I completed Assignment 3 independently with a lot of help from the matplotlib documentation, the Stats Model documentation, this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42261976/how-to-plot-statsmodels-linear-regression-ols-cleanly) and Professor Bianco's gender bias example notebook.
