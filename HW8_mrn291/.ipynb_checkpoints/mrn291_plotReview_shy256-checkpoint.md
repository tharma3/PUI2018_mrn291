![alt mrn_plot](./distribution_by_borough.png)
Staten Island's Domicile type is overwhelmingly of family-housing, where Single family housing dominates. The opposite is Manhattan, where family-housing is non-existent, and walk-up, elevator (which can be interpreted as *high* rise) housings dominate. Family housing exhibits visibly different ratio. Brooklyn, Bronx, and Queens from the descending order with respect to the ratio of family-housing, which may be related to the relative land value of respective regions. One thing that bugs me is that only the leftmost bar has the black edge, while the rest do not. Other than that, I don't have a particular critique on the plot.
