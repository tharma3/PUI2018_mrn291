CLARITY: The plot is easy to read. 
It is a little bit confusing to me since it does not have label on the y-axis. 
The quantities is not being visualized ambiguous.

ESTHETIC: The plot's esthetic is functional, it has four different colors to represent four different categories.
All the colors are distinguishable. The graphical elements are used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized 
I had a little hard time to remember which color represents which category. But I do not think it is a problem.

HONESTY: The plot is honestly reproducing the data.

All in all, Martha did a really good job on the visualization. What I would add is the label of the y-axis.
I would probably also make the scale of the y-axis smaller so that we can see the quantity of each category more clear.
