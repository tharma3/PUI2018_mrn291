# Homework Assignment 10 for PUI2018 Evening Session

#### Assignment 1

For this assignment, we were asked to finish the in-class lab.  I did this assignment independently, consulting the Statsmodels documentation and also the [wikipedia entry for likelihood ratios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood-ratio_test)


#### Assignment 2

For this assignment, we were asked to build several different models to describe the relationship between the number of units in a building and the total energy used by the building.  I (almost) completed this lab independently, consulting Dr. Bianco's example notebooks from the UI repository, the slides, as well as the following internet resources.
