# Homework Assignment 11 for PUI2018 Evening Session

#### Assignment 1

For this assignment, we were asked to do some time series analysis as well as build a classifier to try and assign a card type based on the characteristics of the time series.

I worked on this assignment with help from Ilyas, Christine Biddlecombe, whom I asked a question about reassigning -1s as NaNs, and lots of help from the internet, including [this article on making 3d arrays into dataframes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35525028/how-to-transform-a-3d-arrays-into-a-dataframe-in-python).


#### Assignment 2

For this assignment, we were asked to incorporate our reviewers' feedback on our plots.  I fixed the weird border thing going on!  I worked independently on this assignment.
